# SpotifyClone
Spotify Clone - A project developed to simulate the Spotify experience, featuring functionalities such as music playback, playlists, audio controls, and a user interface similar to the original platform. The goal is to enhance my skills in HTML5, CSS 3 and JavaScript and gain a deeper understanding of multimedia application development.
